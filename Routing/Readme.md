The purpose of this lab is to practice Redistribution between different routing protocols so that all networks can communicate with each other.
In this lab we used:

Static Routing
Default Routing
RIP
OSPF
EIGRP
All connected to a Core Router.

üñ•Ô∏è Topology
A Core Router is connected to five routers, each running a different routing protocol.
Each router has LANs and PCs behind it to test connectivity.
The goal is that any device in any network can reach devices in other networks.

üìë Notes
The full configuration is already inside the .pkt file.
To check the configuration of any router, open the lab in Packet Tracer and run:
show running-config

Make sure to test connectivity using ping between devices to confirm that Redistribution works correctly.

‚úÖ Outcome
All networks are now connected.
Practiced how to perform Redistribution between multiple routing protocols in a CCNA lab environment.

# Switching Lab

This folder contains a single comprehensive CCNA switching lab that covers multiple core topics:  

- **VLAN Configuration** – Creating and assigning VLANs to switch ports.  
- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** – Ensuring loop-free topologies in redundant networks.  
- **EtherChannel (LACP)** – Bundling multiple links for redundancy and load balancing.  
- **Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)** – Enabling communication between VLANs using a router.  

The lab is designed as an all-in-one practical exercise for hands-on learning and testing in multi-switch environments.

# CCNA Labs Repository  

This repository contains a collection of **hands-on CCNA labs** organized by major networking domains.  
Each lab is designed to reinforce theoretical knowledge with practical configuration and testing in Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3.  

## üìÇ Folder Structure  

- **Routing/**  
  Includes multiple labs covering different routing protocols and redistribution scenarios:  
  - *EIGRP Lab* ‚Äì Basic configuration and verification of EIGRP.  
  - *OSPF Lab* ‚Äì Single-area OSPF configuration with neighbor adjacency checks.  
  - *Redistribution Lab* ‚Äì Integrates multiple routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP v2, Static, Default) using redistribution.  

- **Switching/**  
  A single comprehensive lab covering:  
  - VLAN configuration  
  - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)  
  - EtherChannel with LACP  
  - Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)  

- **Security/**  
  Labs focusing on Access Control Lists (ACLs) and basic network traffic filtering:  
  - Examples include full device blocking, selective service restrictions (web/ping), and per-subnet rules.  

## üéØ Purpose  

This repo is built to help learners:  
- Practice **realistic CCNA-level labs**.  
- Understand configuration and verification commands (`show run`, `show ip route`, `ping`, etc.).  
- Build a strong foundation in **Routing, Switching, and Security** for the CCNA exam.

‚úçÔ∏è *Note:* Configurations are not hardcoded in the README files. Instead, use device CLI (`show run`) inside each lab to explore the setup.
